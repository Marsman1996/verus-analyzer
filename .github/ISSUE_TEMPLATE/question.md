Otherwise please try to provide information which will help us to fix the issue faster. Minimal reproducible examples with few dependencies are especially lovely <3.

Please keep in mind that this software is experimental: some features are likely broken. At present, it works best on small, self-contained Verus projects. Anything more complex will likely fail. You may file issues, but we do not currently have dedicated engineering support for verus-analyzer, so your issue may not be addressed. Pull requests with fixes are always welcome, although it is unlikely they will be reviewed immediately.
